# SuperRangeSlider
A Wordpress custom range slider built as a Visual Composer Element. Allows user to set the start, middle, and end value to allow the center point of the element to be different than center of the numerical range. Below the middle should be 500 but the slider allows you to set it to 300. The number above can be set to a fraction of the slider value.

Similar idea to the range slider on [Redfin's](https://www.redfin.com/) homepage. Scroll down to the 6th div to check it out.

To add this element to your Wordpress site add the files into your current theme folder and add the following line to your /wp-content/themes/theme_name/functions.php file:

`include __DIR__ . '/directory/of/files';` 

Here's what it looks like in action:
